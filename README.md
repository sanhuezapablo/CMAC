# CMAC (Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer) - Robot Learning

## Overview
The cerebellar model arithmetic computer (CMAC) is a type of neural network based on a model of the mammalian cerebellum. It is also known as the cerebellar model articulation controller.
Here you will find the algorithm coded in Python. To demosntrate the algorithm I used the sine function to show the approximation given by the CMAC algorithm.
